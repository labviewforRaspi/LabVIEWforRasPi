The Home edition is applicable for Home not-for-profit projects and Academic use, while the Standard edition is suited for commercial applications. Make sure to read through the License Agreement document for all licensind details. The VIP file that is most applicable to you is to be downloaded and installed on the development machine in order to compile and download LabVIEW code to your Raspberry Pi. Dowload the Raspberry Pi image from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7DdMz7ZefcwMjlzVlM3OGxJVWs?usp=sharing). 

Make sure to burn a SD Card with the image dowloaded from the link above, even though the official Raspberry Pi PIXEL Operating System is maintained untouched in that image, all the necessary support packages have been installed and properly configured so your Raspberry Pi is ready to receive compiled LabVIEW code. We will not provide support if you decide to update your Pi's operating system via sudo update. We will do our best to release updated images as the Raspberry Pi organization updates the released OS.
